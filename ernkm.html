A large number of migratory birds visit this place. Spiders and bats are the main attractions here. 
              The Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary which was established in 2004 is the smallest protected area under the state forest department. It is the only bird sanctuary in Kerala which is located in Mangrove forests. The word Mangal means mangroves in Portuguese. A survey conducted in May 2006 found that there are 194 birds in 32 species. 
              The number of bird species recorded so far from this area is 72. In addition, 17 species of butterflies are recorded here. There are 51 different types of spiders</p>
            <p>Recently the high-rise buildings surrounding the area are curtailing the movement of birds in the sanctuary. The buildings close to the sanctuary interrupt proper orientation, take-off and landings of the birds. They also cause hurdles in the regular movements of the nesting birds in transporting nesting materials. </p>
