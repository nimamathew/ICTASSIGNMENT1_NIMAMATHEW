            <p class="card-text">Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary is the northernmost wildlife sanctuary of Kerala, southwest India. It is 55 km2 (21 sq mi) in area and located on the western slope of the Western Ghats. It was established in 1984. The headquarters of the sanctuary is near Iritty. Aralam Wildlife Sanctuary is situated in the southeast part of Kannur District. It lies between 11° 54′ and 11° 59′ north latitude and 75° 47′ and 75° 57′ east longitude.
                             The sanctuary area falls in Aralam, Kelakam and Kottiyoor revenue villages and is located in the northwest slopes of Western Ghats contiguous with the forests of Coorg (Kodagu) district of Karnataka state.
                            The PA (protected area) consists of Aralam Range, the only range of Aralam wildlife division, which is part of Northern Wildlife Circle (Northern Region) Palakkad. The extent of the sanctuary is 55 square kilometres (21 sq mi). The sanctuary was constituted in 1984 as per GO (P) 300/84/AD dated 15 October 1984.
                            It was formed by carving out areas from the Odanthode Malavaram of Thalassery special division which was an erstwhile private forest, subsequently taken over by Govt. as per the provisions of the Kerala Private Forests (vesting and assignment) Act 1971 and from the Kottiyoor RF of Wayanad Forest Division.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Mappila Bay (or Moppila Bay) is a natural harbor situated at Ayikkara in Kannur Municipal Corporation, Kerala state of South India.[1] On one side of the bay is Fort St. Angelo, built by the Portuguese in the 15th century and the other side is the Arakkal Palace.</p>
              <P>The bay was famous during the Kolathiri's regime as a commercial harbour that linked Kolathunadu with Lakshadweep and foreign countries, in imports.</p>
             <p>There are boating options within the bay. If you want to enjoy a ride from the bay to the sea, make sure to check on the weather. It is an interesting walk around the bay, watching the fishermen mend their nets, collect and sort their catch. The best time is when the boats return to the bay, bringing the day’s catch. The trading by fishermen is another interesting activity to watch. Make sure you do not wear your best when visiting the bay. Besides, the smell of fish is overwhelming and the place could use a generous facelift. There is a local market close to the bay that sells the fresh catch from the sea. You get to see some interesting catch here, such as tiger prawn and shark.</p>
